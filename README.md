# Astro-Civilizations Hypothesis

**Cosmic Life Diffusion, Civilization Evolution, and Extraterrestrial Phenomenon Structure Hypothesis**

**《宇宙生命擴散、文明演化與外星現象結構假說》**

A structured hypothesis framework exploring the statistical foundations of cosmic life, the energy and material thresholds of civilization evolution, and a rigorous multi-source classification model for extraterrestrial phenomena — grounded in physics, engineering feasibility, and falsifiable reasoning.

> This is a living document. Contributions, critiques, and falsification attempts are welcome.
