# Planetary Relay Hypothesis

**行星接力假說**

A structured hypothesis framework exploring the statistical foundations of cosmic life, the energy and material thresholds of civilization evolution, and a rigorous multi-source classification model for extraterrestrial phenomena — grounded in physics, engineering feasibility, and falsifiable reasoning.
